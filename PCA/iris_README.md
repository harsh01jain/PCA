The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and statistics, often used for classification tasks. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can belong to one of three classes: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

Here's a description of the columns in the Iris dataset:

Sepal Length (cm): Length of the sepal (the green leaf-like structures of the flower) in centimeters.
Sepal Width (cm): Width of the sepal in centimeters.
Petal Length (cm): Length of the petal (the colorful part of the flower) in centimeters.
Petal Width (cm): Width of the petal in centimeters.
Species: Species of the iris flower. This is the target variable and can be one of the following classes:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
